    * it's tool to find bughost with domain or ip .
this tool change the last 3 numbers in ip
if you choose it please write ip only like

    * this is better than the last tool (find) Although it's running with ip only but you can write ip with prefix like this 192.168.1.0/24 to scan 255 ip to find bughost
    
* [3]:Scan extracted bughosts
    * bughosts saved in host.txt and this tool will scan it automatically | now I found the name server (cloudflare) In my case>> then it's working with hatunnel plus or other VPN app
